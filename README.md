ULift is an app of sympathetic rides that connects drivers with free seats in cars and riders that have similar itineraries, without profit in mind.

Initially it's made to work at [CEFET-MG Campus V](http://www.divinopolis.cefetmg.br/) .

Why ride with ULift?  

ULift offers security to users, the app access is made through login, being restricted to people in the university community. Besides that, you are the one to choose to who you want to offer ride, and with whou you want to ride, based in custom filters and ratings. All that is made through real-time updates, that facilitate communication between users.
